		<h2>Scoring</h2>
		<p>The total ESS score is the sum of eight item-scores and can range between 0 and 24. The higher the score, the higher the person’s level of daytime sleepiness. Most people can answer the ESS, without assistance, in two or three minutes. The total ESS score provides an estimate of a general characteristic of each person – their average level of sleepiness in daily life. This can be influenced by many factors, and the ESS does not distinguish which factor(s) have caused any particular level of daytime sleepiness. It is not a diagnostic tool in itself, but is a very useful tool for measuring one important aspect of a person’s sleep-wake health status.</p>
